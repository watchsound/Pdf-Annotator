Add Notes to PDF in Android (kotlin+compose)

iOS offers the capability to include annotations in PDF files, a feature currently unavailable on Android. 
To the best of my knowledge, there are no open-source projects supporting the addition of notes to PDFs 
on the Android platform. A reading application or ebook may not be suitable for studying without this 
functionality. Consequently, I have chosen to develop a demo project for my inaugural Kotlin/Compose 
project to address this gap and provide support for adding annotations to PDFs on Android. (thanks, chatGPT)
